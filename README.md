### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Valentin
I am currently a Master student in Computer Vision and Image Processing at the Czech Technical University in Prague

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a personal project to implemente lens distortion simulation in OpenGL (https://github.com/Vlhermitte/LensDistortionOpenGL)

The final goal is to create a sandbox where you can create your own environement, and generate a dataset of images if you wish to test your camera calibration algorithm accuracy.

### Hi there 👋 my name is Valentin
I am a Master student in Computer Vision and Image Processing at the Czech Technical University in Prague

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a personal project to implemente lens distortion simulation in OpenGL (https://github.com/Vlhermitte/LensDistortionOpenGL) <br />
The final goal is to create a sandbox where you can create your own environement, and generate a dataset of images if you wish to test your camera calibration algorithm accuracy.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning about Camera Calibration, 3D reconstruction, and Local Feature Matching
